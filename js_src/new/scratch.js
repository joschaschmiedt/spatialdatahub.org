/*
Here I want to set up the function that decides whether to add data to the map
or to take it away, and if the data aren't available to add, calls the get data
functions.
*/
/*
Seems like it's more than one function, but it should also be able to add data
to two different containers, the first is simply the points dataset container,
and the second is a cluster dataset container. Maybe this function shoudl only
deal with the points datasets, and then there should be a function that converts
the datasets to marker cluster layers and adds them to their own object.
*/




// function one will call the get data functions

// function two will decide whether to call function one or not

// function three will decide whether to add the data to the map or not

// function four will give the data to function three
