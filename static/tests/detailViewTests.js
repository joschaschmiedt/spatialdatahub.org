/*
  for the load dataset function I need to have a dataset ready that I can load
  and test out.
  All I have to do is give the test a number for a dataset, but the dataset associated
  with that number will change as I work on the project and as datasets are added.
  there needs to be a way to do these tests with a prepared database
  I need to create some mock stuff, or a way to use preset dataset stuff.
