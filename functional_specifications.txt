OVERVIEW

This is the document that contains the functional specifications for the ZMT GIS Web Portal project. It's sister document "technical_specifications.txt" contains the project's technical specifications.


The ZMT GIS Web Portal is a website that will allow the visualization of spatial data collected by the ZMT and other sources in a single location. Users will be able to view GIS maps populated with real time data (e.g. weather data, wave data, etc.). --> More to be added

This website will avoid acronyms. ZMT and GIS are approved acronyms, but they will go no further than that! We will NOT subject the clients to the excruciating task of mentally decoding a drop down list of 20 seemingly identical acronyms WRITTEN IN ALL CAPS.


SCENARIOS

Scenario 1: James the botanist.
James is a government funded botanist who is searching the internet for information on a species of tropical plants. Fortunately, James knows about the ZMT. He intelligently goes to the new ZMT GIS Web Portal and enters "Tropicalus plantus" in the search bar. This brings up a list of all ZMT's shapefiles that have to do with the plant species T. plantus. He hits the check mark next to the first shape file, and dots appear on the map at all of the gps points that are in the shape file. One of the points is in an unusual place, James has never heard of T. plantus in this area, so he clicks on the point to get more details. He is brought to a page that shows all of the data pertinant to that point, the researcher who created the shape file included the date of the record, the number of individual plants, and some other relevant information on the area. James is extremely pleased. He hits a button that allows him to download the shapefile to his own computer.

Scenario 2: Maxine the precious highschool student.
Maxine is a very smart student who loves the ocean and all the creatures that live there. She is especially excited about Nudibranchs. For her advanced high school biology class she wants to create a species distribution model for the marine gastropod Elysia rufescens (which is not actually a nudibranch, although it resembles one). Maxine uses Google to search the terms "Tropical Nudibranch Maps" and is delighted to find a link to the ZMT GIS Web Portal. She clicks the link and finds that the main page has a large map view along with a column with a search bar. --> More to be added
