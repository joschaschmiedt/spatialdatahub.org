DISCLAIMER

This document is incomplete and will need to be revisited many times before it is complete.


OVERVIEW

This is the document that contains the technical specifications for the ZMT GIS Web Portal project. It's sister document "functional_specifications.txt" contains the project's functional specifications.

The ZMT GIS Web Portal is a website that will allow the visualization of spatial data collected by the ZMT and other sources in a single location. Users will be able to view GIS maps populated with real time data (e.g. weather data, wave data, etc.). --> More to be added


SOFTWARE

    Python 3
    Javascript

    html

  FRAMEWORKS

      -The plan is to continually upgrade this to stay current. 1.10, 1.11, 1.12... when do they get to 2.0?
    Bootstrap 3

  SERVERS
    This will all be put onto a virtual server that is at the ZMT, but to run python on the server we will be using Gunicorn, and to serve the static files we will use NGINX.


OPEN ISSUES

This project may require something special for the underlying database. I know how to hook Django up to a Postgres database, but I don't quite know how to hook it up to a database that is based on Arc software or something like that. <-- I will start with a Postgres database, then see what I can figure out from there.
