This project is built around the ability to project maps of different types
from password protected and non password protected urls. It will use GDAL
ogr2ogr library to convert the map datasets to GeoJSON format. The map
background will be provided by the javascript library Leaflet.js. Users of the
site will be able to view and download data that are projected to the site,
unless specified.
